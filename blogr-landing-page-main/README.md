# Blogr Landing Page - Frontend Development Project

![Design preview for the Blogr landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone! Here is a quick frontend project I worked on comprising of Javascript, HTML and CSS. This project is part of the frontend mentor program which focuses on improving user's coding skills. All designs were created by them and this time rather than being involved with the UX/UI design, I focused purely on all coding aspects for the work.

Let me know your thoughts on the outcome!

Thank you! :)
