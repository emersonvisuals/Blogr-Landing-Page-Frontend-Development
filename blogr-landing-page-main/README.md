## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone! Here is a quick frontend project I worked on comprising of Javascript, HTML and CSS. This project is part of the frontend mentor program which focuses on improving user's coding skills. All designs were created by them and this time I focused on all coding aspects for the work.
